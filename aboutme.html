      <p>I am a tutor with over a decade of experience. I'm passionate about helping students reach their goals now while teaching them skills they will continue to use in the future.</p>
      <p>First, I want to share with you my qualifications. I have a B.S. in Geology and completed a post-degree teaching certification program at UNLV. I have worked in the oil &amp; gas industry, in public school classrooms, and am currently an editor for the Darwin Manuscripts Project at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.</p>
      <p>What I really love to do, though, is share my passion for learning through tutoring. I've been tutoring for over a decade, including 6 years at a highly sought after tutoring firm in Manhattan. While there, I was awarded Top Tutor for my student&#8217;s drastic score increases &#8211; this was out of a team of 60 tutors some with as many as 25 years of experience. This work also gave me experience writing content for standardized test prep curriculum and the opportunity to work with, be mentored by, and mentor some outstanding educators.</p>
      <p>I have experience tutoring a wide range of standardized tests, and I specialize in math and science. My all-time favorite students are those who are stuck in a negative mindset. &#8220;I&#8217;m no good at math.&#8221; &#8220;Chemistry is too hard for me.&#8221; I can so fully empathize with these students, as a math &amp; science avoider for many years of my life. I can also share my insights and passion for those same topics now that they are among my favorite things!</p>
      <p>My other specialty is in learning differences. Over half of my test prep students had a diagnosis that allowed for extended time or other accommodations for the SAT/ACT, so I have developed many strategies and methods for these students. In addition to simply working with students with learning disabilities of all kinds, I&#8217;ve also received trainings from multiple LD centers and am continually educating myself so as to best serve my students.</p>
      <p>The families I work with often stay with me for years and through multiple subjects and multiple siblings. I'm warm and empathetic while also highly organized and focused on the work that we are meant to be doing together. I am dependable and easy to communicate with. I am not a tutor who just shows up at the arranged time and then leaves. I keep parents updated with regular progress notes. I think about my student &#8220;after hours&#8221; and am always brainstorming how to best teach them. I spend time prepping between sessions. And, since I&#8217;m fascinated with learning, I&#8217;m constantly reading books, listening to podcasts, and taking classes to expose myself to more ideas.</p>
      <p>I'd love to hear more about the needs of your student. Please, do not hesitate to reach out with any questions or comments!</p>
      <p>Best,</p>
      <p >Drew</p>
